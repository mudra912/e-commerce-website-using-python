Step by Step Implementation: 
Create Normal Project: Open the IDE and create a normal project by selecting File -> New Project.
Install Django: Next, we will install the Django module from the terminal. We will use PyCharm integrated terminal to do this task. One can also use cmd on windows to install the module by running python -m pip install django command
Check Installed Django version: To check the installed Django version, you can run the python -m django -version command as shown below.
Create Django Project: When we execute django-admin startproject command, then it will create a Django project inside the normal project which we already have created here. django-admin startproject ProjectName.
Check Python3 version: python3 –version
Run Default Django webserver:- Django internally provides a default webserver where we can launch our applications. python manage.py runserver command in terminal. By default, the server runs on port 8000. Access the webserver at the highlighted URL.
